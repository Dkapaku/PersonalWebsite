        Hello! I'm David Kapaku, a highly motivated fullstack developer
        who recently completed an intensive training program in web
        development. Throughout my studies, I've gained a 
        solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, and Express. I'm excited to apply my newly 
        acquired skills and knowledge to build dynamic and user-friendly web applications. 
        My attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and dedication to continuous learning 
        make me a strong candidate for any team looking for a passionate and enthusiastic fullstack developer.
